#Back up of a single partition (tar = only files and folders)
#In this case, you need the partition mounted. To see the list of mounted partitions type on Cygwin Terminal
#Code:
#adb shell mount
#Now you need to know where is mounted the partition you want to backup, for example the firmware is mounted on /system, which is the ROM.
#In this case you will have to open three terminals, because of android limitations:
#
#Open one Cygwin terminal and create a fifo, in /cache, for example, and redirect the tar there
#Code:
#adb forward tcp:5555 tcp:5555
#adb shell
#su
#/system/xbin/busybox mkfifo /cache/myfifo
#/system/xbin/busybox tar -cvf /cache/myfifo /system
#We have to do it this way because redirecting the tar to stdout (with - ) is broken on android and will corrupt the tar file.
#
#Open a second Cygwin terminal and type:
#Code:
#adb forward tcp:5555 tcp:5555
#adb shell
#su
#/system/xbin/busybox nc -l -p 5555 -e /system/xbin/busybox cat /cache/myfifo
#
#Open a third Cygwin terminal and type:
#Code:
#adb forward tcp:5555 tcp:5555
#cd /path/to/store/the/backup
#nc 127.0.0.1 5555 | pv -i 0.5 > system.tar
#
#You can browse the tar file with Winrar, Total Commander, PeaZip and almost any compression tool. Note that you shouldn't extract files or edit it since the tar format saves the permission and owner data for each file, that is lost when extracted to FAT / NTFS partitions and you will mess things when restoring.
