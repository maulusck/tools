# Podman container management scripts

Useful when handling multiple podman containers from a designated user location.

Docs are still not ready.

The scripts are now standalone. Variables need to be edited per-script.
Take care to scripts that work together, such as `backup-volumes.sh` and `prune-backups.sh`.
